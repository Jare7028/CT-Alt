# CT Alt feature coverage

Target: an independently implemented workforce app with close Connecteam feature, screen and workflow parity, using CT Alt branding. A working branch or preview does not count as a production release. Full current-reference visual parity remains unverified.

## Current production and release queue

Latest application release: `37229f9640235a3c2d8d3d9f08baa6b3cbc76144`. Vercel production `dpl_7exAWu1mk9T2vJvBD4x6YW2YoLn5` is READY and aliased to ct-alt.vercel.app. Live login renders; unauthenticated Agents redirects to login. Real-account authenticated production workflows were not exercised.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Wider workforce scope

These areas remain unimplemented unless a future release records specific evidence here:

- Overview and activity; global search, notifications and automations.
- Smart groups, detailed administrator permissions, organisational directory and job catalogue.
- Time clock, timesheets, attendance and payroll/reporting integrations.
- Time off, availability, open-shift requests and scheduling approval workflows.
- Updates, surveys, forms, quick tasks, contracts, knowledge bases and documents.
- Onboarding, hiring, courses, quizzes and training records.
- Events, help desk, rewards, recognition, celebrations and organisation chart.
- Employee mobile workflows, accessibility, large-directory pagination and complete visual fidelity.

## Release evidence

For every delivered slice, record functional scope, local checks, browser/API permission evidence, actual rendered desktop/mobile captures, deployed commit and hosted acceptance. Keep gaps explicit. Use synthetic fixtures and only verified CT Alt resources; all services remain free.

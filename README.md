# CT Alt

An independently implemented workforce application. Agents and their access permissions come first, followed by client rotas and team communication. The long-term scope is a complete workforce platform, delivered and verified module by module.

## Current state

This repository contains an original Next.js/TypeScript foundation and a static development landing page. A proposed database migration defines tenant memberships and read-access policies; it has not been applied remotely or connected to the app. Authentication screens, Agents management and scheduling are not implemented yet. No database, hosting integration, external service or production data is connected to the app.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 24 and npm:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5180. No environment variables or provider accounts are needed for this scaffold.

```sh
npm run check
npm run build
npm start
```

`check` runs strict linting and TypeScript validation. The initial CI repeats these checks and builds the application. Feature acceptance tests will be added with the corresponding implementation; a successful scaffold build is not evidence of workforce functionality.

## Delivery sequence

1. Verify independent repository, database/Auth and hosting resources with no paid upgrades or usage-billed provisioning.
2. Deliver the Agents module: company memberships, user/agent management and role enforcement. One person may belong to multiple companies, with a separate role in each.
3. Deliver client rotas end to end: manager planning, employee assignment, draft/publish, employee views, conflict detection and concurrent-edit protection. Test tenant isolation, time zones, DST and overnight shifts.
4. Add chat and group communication, then company updates and time-off workflows.
5. Expand the remaining workforce modules, including time tracking and knowledge management, and later training integration. These remain in scope even when lower priority.

## Isolation and public-source rules

- This project has its own release lifecycle. Do not connect it to another application's database, Auth, storage, deployment or service credentials.
- Use synthetic test data. Keep credentials, session files, real people/company records and database exports out of source, logs and CI artifacts.
- `.env.example` contains documentation only. Actual local environment files and provider bindings are ignored.
- No existing application source, branding, proprietary documents or migration history has been imported.
- Hosted deployment and database connection remain separate setup steps. Do not provision paid resources or enable billing automatically.

CI uses a standard Ubuntu runner for this public repository, with no uploaded artifacts or persistent cache. It has read-only repository permissions and no deployment steps or provider secrets.

Public visibility does not choose an open-source license. No license grant is added by this scaffold; dependency licenses remain their respective authors'.

## Proposed database foundation

`supabase/migrations/20261003141241_workforce_foundation.sql` creates only `tenants`, `tenant_memberships`, RLS policies and internal helpers. Roles are owner, admin, manager and employee. Active members can read their companies; employees can read only their own membership; managers/admins/owners can read their company's directory. Suspended companies/memberships, anonymous Auth users and unconfirmed identities have no access. User-editable metadata cannot grant access.

Browser roles cannot create or mutate tenants/memberships. No signup hook, invitation delivery, global-admin role, service credential or account-provisioning RPC is included. Those operations need tested server authorization and audit handling with the Agents implementation. Do not mistake this migration for a completed Agents module.

The privileged service role bypasses RLS. Never expose it to browsers, and never use it for ordinary user reads. Future scheduling records should use composite tenant-bound foreign keys to memberships; application filtering alone is insufficient.

Run the database assertions with Docker:

```sh
npm run test:db
```

The runner creates its own temporary PostgreSQL 17 container with no network, no exposed ports and synthetic fixtures, then removes that container. It accepts no database URL and never uses the connected Supabase project. The image is pinned by digest. The tests emulate only the minimal Supabase Auth schema/identity contract; they do not test actual sessions, PostgREST, email or hosted configuration.

Before remote application, verify the intended independent project's identity and Free plan, inspect its schema/history for conflicts, and apply through the parent-controlled migration process. This repository has no automated remote migration or deployment step. `tests/database/bootstrap.sql` is local-only and must never be applied to a hosted project. Configure exposed API schemas to exclude `workforce_private`, and run hosted read-only policy/advisor checks after application.
